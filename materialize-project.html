              <p>Some time after the end of the world as we knew it, a nation was established in North America that would soon come to be known as Panem. It is unknown precisely when Panem was established and how long it has existed, though it is certain that Panem has been around for more than seventy-five years, and it's entirely possible for it to be at least a century or two old.

It's located in the Appalachia and has a population of around 8,000 or more people. District 12's main industry is coal mining. However, after the Second Rebellion, their main industry became medicine.</p>

        <p class "flow-text" teal darken-4"> The Capitol of Panem is a technologically advanced, utopian city where the nation's most wealthy and powerful live. The Capitol is also the colloquial name for ruling government of Panem. As the seat of power in Panem, the nation's thirteen districts (twelve after The Dark Days) are ruled from this city, and the Hunger Games are organized and celebrated inside its walls. The Capitol is a tyrannical dictatorship, led by President Snow (before his death), and holds total political and economic dominance over Panem, enforcing its rule through an army of Peacekeepers, capital punishment, propaganda, and the Hunger Games. It is also the only major city mentioned in the trilogy. The Capitol is known for its fashion and food. Following the events of Mockingjay, Paylor becomes the new president. </p>
